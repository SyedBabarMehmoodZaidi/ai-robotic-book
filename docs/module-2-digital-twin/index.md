# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments for robotics
- Create Unity simulations for visualization and human-robot interaction
- Understand URDF/SDF format differences and conversions
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) in digital environments
- Execute exercises that demonstrate digital twin concepts with sensor data visualization

## Module Overview

The Digital Twin concept is fundamental to modern robotics development, allowing engineers to test control algorithms safely in simulation before deploying to physical robots. This module covers two primary simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-accurate simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction.

Digital twins provide a safe, cost-effective, and rapid prototyping environment for robotics development. They allow for:
- Testing of control algorithms without risk to physical hardware
- Reproducible experiments with controlled conditions
- Sensor simulation and validation
- Training of AI models with synthetic data
- Collaboration and visualization for human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- A working Gazebo installation (Garden or Fortress recommended)
- Unity Hub and Unity Editor installed (2022.3 LTS recommended)
- Basic understanding of physics simulation concepts
- Completed the installation guide in the appendices

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **Gazebo Setup**: Configuring physics-accurate simulation environments
2. **Unity Simulation**: High-fidelity visualization and interaction
3. **URDF/SDF Formats**: Understanding and converting between formats
