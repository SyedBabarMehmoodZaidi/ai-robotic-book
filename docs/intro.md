# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This comprehensive educational resource is designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, robotics enthusiasts, and educators exploring Physical AI and embodied intelligence.

<QueryInterface />

## About This Book

This book provides hands-on, practical learning of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. You will design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and GPT-integrated Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

The content is organized into four progressive modules that build upon each other:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture including Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation and digital environments for safe robot testing
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Integrate AI systems for perception, navigation, and decision-making
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Create robots that understand and execute natural language commands

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Graduate and advanced undergraduate students
- Robotics enthusiasts
- Educators exploring Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Developers interested in robotics and AI integration

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Computer with sufficient resources for simulation (8GB+ RAM, dedicated GPU recommended)

## Learning Approach

Each module includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Hands-on exercises
- Checkpoints for assessment
- Real-world examples and applications

The exercises are designed to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical implementation, ensuring you gain both knowledge and experience.

## Technical Requirements

- ROS 2 (recommended: Humble Hawksbill)
- Gazebo Garden or Fortress
- Unity Hub with appropriate version
- NVIDIA Isaac tools (where applicable)
- Python dependencies as specified in exercises

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational knowledge required for all subsequent modules. Each module is designed to be completed in sequence, with later modules building on concepts from earlier ones.

### Using the AI Assistant

This book includes an integrated AI assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. You can ask questions about the book content directly on any page using the "Ask AI" interface.

**How to use the AI assistant:**
1. Type your question in the text input field
2. Optionally, select text on the page to provide additional context
3. Click "Ask AI" to submit your question
4. Review the AI-generated response and cited sources
5. Check the confidence score to assess response reliability

The AI assistant can help clarify concepts, provide explanations, and connect ideas across different sections of the book.
