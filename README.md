# AI/Spec-Driven Book: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This repository contains a comprehensive educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus. The book follows a 4-module structure: ROS 2 fundamentals, Digital Twin simulation, AI integration, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Overview

This educational resource provides hands-on learning of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Students will design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and GPT-integrated Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Modules

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - ROS 2 architecture fundamentals
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation environments
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - AI integration for robotics
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Natural language interaction

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-robotic-book.git
   cd ai-robotic-book
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start local development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will start a local development server and open the documentation in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
